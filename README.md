# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- For Register and login use the following credentials :
- email : eve.holt@reqres.in, Password :pistol
- Because from front end only i m handling the severe by taking dummy API
- and For payment gateway i have used stripe.com
- For state managment i used Context API hook
